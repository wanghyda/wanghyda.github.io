  Hello! I‚Äôm **Haoyu Wang**, an undergraduate student majoring in Automation at **Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech)**. I am deeply passionate about the intersection of **intelligent sensing, multimodal data processing, and machine learning**, and I aim to apply these technologies to address complex challenges in areas such as robotics, industrial automation, and safety monitoring.  

Emphasis on my email again **wanghy2022@mail.sustech.edu.cn**, You can copy my email address in advance so that you can contact me at any timeÔºÅüòâüòâüòâ

With a strong foundation in automation and intelligent systems, I have led and participated in various research projects, consistently striving to push the boundaries of innovation. My journey has been driven by a commitment to combining cutting-edge technology with real-world applications.  

Research Interests
======
My academic pursuits center around:  
- **Intelligent Sensing and Data Fusion**: Exploring how different sensing modalities can complement each other for improved system efficiency.  
- **Edge Computing and Vision Systems**: Developing resource-efficient solutions for real-time applications.  
- **Multimodal Interaction**: Integrating vision, sound, and environmental data for seamless human-machine collaboration.

Of course, now I am still exploring some things that interest me, such as robot acoustics, robot clustering, etc. I like to keep exploring and learning. I believe in the power of **interdisciplinary research** and always seek opportunities to collaborate across domains. Detailed insights into my projects can be found in my [CV](./cv.md).  

Leadership and Student Work 
======
Beyond my academic work, I actively contribute to the university community as a **student leader** and **volunteer**. Here are some highlights of my extracurricular engagement:  
- **Director of External Relations**, Ming Hang Voluntary Teaching Association: As a volunteer teacher, I have been to underdeveloped areas twice as a volunteer teacher, and I have tried my best to pass on the knowledge and skills I have learned to the children there.
- **Youth League Secretary and Class Monitor**: Organized community-building activities and fostered a positive learning environment for my peers.  
- **Vice President**, SUSTech Maple Tea Society: Promoted cultural exchange through creative events and initiatives.  

These experiences have enhanced my leadership, teamwork, and organizational skills, shaping me into a well-rounded individual dedicated to both professional and social growth.
